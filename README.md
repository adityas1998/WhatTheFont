# WhatTheFont: Implementation of Deep Font


This is the source code for the CS1470 (Deep Learning) final project, which is a reimplementation of 
[DeepFont](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.03196.pdf). This reimplementation was created by [Minna Kimura-Thollander](https://github.com/minnakt), [Katherine Sang](https://github.com/artset), and [Maggie Wu](https://github.com/maggie1059)

The /data folder contains all scripts ran to preprocess images from [AdobeVFR](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o320sowg790cxpe/AADDmdwQ08GbciWnaC20oAmna?dl=0).
The /model folder contains a reimplementation of the original model featured in the paper, as well as a modified version based on the guidance of Prof. Ritchie. Lastly, the /bcf_file folder contains the scripts necessary to unpack the bcf file given with AdobeVFR.

The poster presented on Deep Learning Day (12.12.2019) can be found [here](https://github.com/artset/WhatTheFont/blob/master/12.11_poster.pdf).
